# SWEBAK_Bakery
 19-MAY-2023, Web programming (project)
 
We chose to create a website for a bakery selling cakes, bread, and Tarts .This website will make the process easier and faster to achieve his works in a faster and effective way without losing data and information of each table and user.

- Customers can buy from this website anything, and admin (manager of the website) can update, edit, delete, and add several kind of bread and classes and new purchases to the website to be shown to the users.

- This website, which is called (SWEBAK), offers features to allow the customers to buy on an easy responsive website and many other features for the manager.

We used the bootstrap library, and used to generate HTML elements using three methods which are PHP, JavaScript, and jQuery.
About backend side, we used MySQL object to manage the database which allows us to make different queries such as select, insert, and
update.
